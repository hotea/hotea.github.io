## Why Astro?

After going through Hexo and Pelican, I decided to rebuild my personal site with [Astro](https://astro.build) -- a modern static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default.

### What I was looking for

- **Performance**: Ship minimal JavaScript, fast page loads
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript, component-based architecture, hot module reload
- **Content-first**: Native Markdown/MDX support with content collections
- **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate with any UI framework if needed

### The Stack

This site is built with:

- **Astro** - Static site framework
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **MDX** - Enhanced Markdown for blog posts

### What's next

I plan to write more about:

- Data structures and algorithms
- Web development techniques
- Tools and productivity tips

Stay tuned for more posts!
